cryptsetup (2:2.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    No longer sleep after exceeding the maximum number of unlocking
    tries.  This was added in 2:1.7.3-2 as an attempt to mitigate
    CVE-2016-4484.  To avoid dropping to the debug shell after exceeding
    the maximum number of unlocking tries, users need to use the 'panic'
    boot parameter and lock down their boot loader & BIOS/UEFI.
